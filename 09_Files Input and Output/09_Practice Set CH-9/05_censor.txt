He's being such a #### to everyone lately.
This is total #### and you know it.

Why are you being so damn rude all the time?
He's a lazy ### who never does anything right.
Oh shut up, you #####.
That was a ###### move and you know it.
Don't give me that ######## again.
The project failed because someone messed it up big time â€” cl###ic ########.
You're ####### me off with that attitude.
Ugh, what a dumb idea.
Seriously? That's just stupid.
You always make a mess of everything, like a damn ####.
