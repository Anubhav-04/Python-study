print (''' 
The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s,
and its implementation was started in December 1989
by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor 
to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the 
Amoeba operating system.[3] Van Rossum is Python's principal author, 
and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python 
is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, 
Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL).[4][5] (However, Van Rossum 
stepped down as leader on July 12, 2018.[6]). Python was named after 
the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.[7]
